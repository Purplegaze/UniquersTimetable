# Team Project

Please keep this up-to-date with information about your project throughout the term.

The readme should include information such as:
- a summary of what your application is all about
- a list of the user stories, along with who is responsible for each one
- information about the API(s) that your project uses 
- screenshots or animations demonstrating current functionality

By keeping this README up-to-date,
your team will find it easier to prepare for the final presentation
at the end of the term.


# Contributing

**This repository has branch protection rules enabled.** At least one reviewer must approve of your changes before they can be merged into the main branch.

**Adhere to CheckStyle.**
- While we did not account for CheckStyle issues in the first few weeks of our coding process, __all future commits should adhere to CheckStyle standards__ whenever it is possible to do so without major refactoring.
- This includes:
  - Proper Javadoc comments
  - Meaningful exceptions being thrown and caught rather than e.g. generic RuntimeException
  - Fixing old CheckStyle issues in old code as you come across them. If a restructure would break a significant amount of implementation, consider implementing the clean refactor while leaving the old one available until we have time to phase it out.
